## Parallel Analysis of 3D Time Series Data (C + MPI)
This repo contains the assignment code and report we had submitted for the course CS633 (Parallel Computing) offered by Prof. Preeti Malakar in 2024-25 Sem II at IIT Kanpur. 
The assignment implements a parallel program using MPI in C to analyze time series data of a 3D spatial volume. The objective is to efficiently compute, for each time step: count of local minima, local maxima, the global minimum and maximum values. It was done in a team of 5 members and we received **101/100** marks (15 marks bonus for using Parallel I/O). The following are the team members:

- Pragati Agrawal ([apragati22](https://github.com/apragati22/))
- Dhruv Gupta ([dhruvgupta22](https://github.com/dhruvgupta22/))
